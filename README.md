# Gemma AI Assistant
Project design and creation of a virtual agent, with robust capabilities to efficiently collaborate with health professionals.

## Clear Project Objectives
Develop an Integrated AI Assistant: Create an AI assistant using IBM Watson and IBM Granite, 
capable of interacting with users and providing accurate and relevant medical information.

## Manage Patient Data: Implement a solution to store, access, and manipulate detailed hospitalized patient data, 
including medical histories, treatments, exam results, and more.

## Automate Medical Queries: 
Enable the AI assistant to respond to specific queries about patients, schedules, treatments, and diagnoses.

## Generate Medical Reports: 
Facilitate the creation of comprehensive and detailed medical reports based on the stored information.

## Optimize Patient Care: 
Improve the efficiency and quality of patient care by using advanced technology to manage and query medical data.

## Brief Project Description
This project aims to develop an integrated AI assistant using IBM Watson and IBM Granite to interact with users and provide 
detailed medical information. The assistant will manage hospitalized patient data, automate medical queries, and generate medical 
reports, thus optimizing the quality and efficiency of patient care.

## Detailed and Comprehensive Project Description
## Overview
The project focuses on developing an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant using IBM Watson and IBM Granite technologies. 
This assistant is designed to interact with users, offering precise and relevant responses to medical queries, and managing detailed hospitalized patient data.

## Key Features
## Integrated AI Assistant:

The AI assistant is capable of understanding and processing natural language queries.

It uses IBM Granite for advanced language processing and response generation.

Patient Data Management:

Storage and management of detailed patient data, including medical history, current medications, allergies, surgical interventions, exam results, and more.

Data organized in CSV structures to facilitate access and manipulation.

Automation of Medical Queries:

The assistant can respond to a variety of specific queries about patients, such as diagnoses, exam results, upcoming appointments, current treatments, and more.

It uses defined intents and entities to capture and process specific information provided by the user.

Medical Report Generation:

Capability to generate comprehensive and detailed medical reports based on the information stored in the patient database.

Reports include recent diagnoses, exam results, administered treatments, and observations from medical staff.

Optimization of Patient Care:

Improves the efficiency and quality of patient care by automating administrative tasks and quickly responding to medical queries.

Facilitates communication between medical staff and patients, providing precise and up-to-date information in real-time.
